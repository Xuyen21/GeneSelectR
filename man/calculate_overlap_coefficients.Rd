\title{Calculate Overlap and Similarity Coefficients between Feature Lists}
\usage{
calculate_overlap_coefficients(pipeline_results, custom_lists = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pipeline_results}{A PipelineResults object containing the fitted pipelines, cross-validation results, selected features,
mean performance, and mean feature importances.}

\item{custom_lists}{An optional named list of character vectors. Each character vector should contain feature names.
The names of the list will be used as names in the resulting overlap coefficient matrices.}
}
\value{
A list of lists of matrices showing the Overlap, Jaccard, and Soerensen-Dice coefficients for the feature lists.
This includes coefficients for feature importance, permutation importance (if present), and custom lists (if provided).
}
\description{
This function calculates the Overlap, Jaccard, and Soerensen-Dice coefficients to quantify
the similarity between feature lists. In addition to feature importance and permutation importance,
you can provide a custom list of feature names to be included in the overlap calculation.
